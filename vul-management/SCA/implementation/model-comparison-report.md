- **Test Date**: 2025-07-22

## Model Performance Summary

| Model | Provider | Scan Time | Vulnerabilities Found | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| **grok-3** | X.AI | 218.4s | **53** | 4 | 27 | 22 | 0 |
| **gpt-4o-mini** | OpenAI | 67.3s | **27** | 2 | 24 | 1 | 0 |
| **o1-mini** | OpenAI | 50.2s | **14** | 1 | 8 | 4 | 1 |
| grok-beta | X.AI | 146.7s | 0* | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

*Note: grok-beta model name was incorrect; should use grok-3

## Key Findings

### 1. Vulnerability Detection Variance
- **Grok-3** detected the most vulnerabilities (53), nearly 4x more than o1-mini
- **GPT-4o-mini** found a moderate number (27), 2x more than o1-mini
- Significant variation in detection capabilities between models

### 2. Performance Analysis
- **Fastest**: o1-mini (50.2s) - reasoning model optimized for speed
- **Slowest**: grok-3 (218.4s) - most comprehensive but 4x slower
- **Balanced**: gpt-4o-mini (67.3s) - good speed with reasonable detection

### 3. Detection Coverage by Ecosystem

#### Python Package Vulnerabilities
**Grok-3 unique findings**: cryptography, lxml, pillow, selenium, urllib3, xlrd, jinja2, pyopenssl, pymongo, redis

**GPT-4o-mini unique findings**: django-otp, flask, numpy, pandas, statsmodels

**Common findings**: django, requests, ruamel.yaml

#### JavaScript Package Vulnerabilities  
**Common across models**: minimist, lodash, handlebars, glob, yargs, esprima

**Grok-3 additional**: nth-check, semver, https-proxy-agent, js-yaml, marked, open, undici, fill-range, node-fetch, uglify-js, chalk, core-js, dotenv, fs-extra, postcss, ws, yaml

#### Docker/Container Vulnerabilities
**Only detected by Grok-3**: postgres, localstack, alpine, yarn

### 4. Severity Distribution Patterns
- **Grok-3**: More aggressive in finding critical vulnerabilities (4 vs 1-2)
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Balanced distribution, focused on high-severity issues
- **o1-mini**: Conservative approach with fewer findings overall

## Model Characteristics

### Grok-3 (X.AI)
✅ **Strengths**:
- Most comprehensive vulnerability detection
- Excellent coverage across all ecosystems
- Finds container/Docker vulnerabilities others miss

❌ **Weaknesses**:
- Slowest performance (218.4s)
- Requires correct model name (not grok-beta)
- Higher API costs due to longer processing

### GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)
✅ **Strengths**:
- Good balance of speed and detection
- Strong Python vulnerability knowledge
- Consistent results

❌ **Weaknesses**:
- Misses some JavaScript vulnerabilities
- No Docker/container vulnerability detection
- No live search capability (despite model name)

### o1-mini (OpenAI)
✅ **Strengths**:
- Fastest scan time
- Reasoning model with structured analysis
- Lower cost per scan

❌ **Weaknesses**:
- Least comprehensive detection
- Misses many known vulnerabilities
- No web search capabilities

## Recommendations

1. **For Comprehensive Security Scans**: Use **Grok-3**
   - Best for thorough security audits
   - Worth the extra time for critical applications

2. **For Balanced Daily Scans**: Use **GPT-4o-mini**
   - Good speed-to-detection ratio
   - Suitable for CI/CD pipelines

3. **For Quick Preliminary Scans**: Use **o1-mini**
   - Fast results for initial assessment
   - Follow up with more comprehensive models

4. **Consider Multi-Model Approach**:
   - Use o1-mini for quick daily scans
   - Run Grok-3 weekly for comprehensive analysis
   - Cross-validate critical findings between models

## Technical Observations

1. **Model Names Matter**: Using incorrect model names (e.g., grok-beta) results in API errors
2. **No Live Search**: None of the tested models had working web search capabilities
3. **Context Window Utilization**: All models handled 1,202 packages efficiently with batching
4. **Consistency**: Same packages analyzed differently by each model suggests varying training data

## Conclusion

The significant variation in vulnerability detection between AI models highlights the importance of:
- Choosing the right model for your security requirements
- Understanding each model's strengths and limitations
- Potentially using multiple models for comprehensive coverage
- Regular validation against known vulnerability databases
