My knowledge is based on the data I was trained on, which has a cutoff point.  Therefore, I cannot provide a completely exhaustive and up-to-the-minute list of CVEs for the specified packages.\n\nTo find the most current information, you should consult these resources directly:\n\n* **National Vulnerability Database (NVD):**  Search for each package and version individually (e.g., \"requests 2.25.1\").  This is the most authoritative source for CVE information.\n* **Package maintainers' websites:** Check the official websites or repositories for the projects (requests, Django, NumPy). They often have security advisories or release notes mentioning known vulnerabilities.\n* **Snyk Advisor:** This website provides vulnerability information for various packages and versions.\n* **GitHub advisories:** Search for security advisories related to the packages on GitHub.\n\n\n**Example of how the JSON would look (this is NOT exhaustive and likely outdated):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requests:2.25.1\": {\n    \"cves\": [],\n    \"confidence\": 0.8 \n  },\n  \"django:3.2.0\": {\n    \"cves\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"CVE-YYYY-NNNNN\",  // Replace with actual CVE ID if found\n        \"severity\": \"HIGH\",       // Replace with actual severity\n        \"description\": \"Example:  A vulnerability allowing for XSS attacks.\",\n        \"cvss_score\": 7.5         // Replace with actual CVSS score\n      }\n    ],\n    \"confidence\": 0.7\n  },\n  \"numpy:1.19.0\": {\n    \"cves\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"CVE-ZZZZ-MMMMM\", // Replace with actual CVE ID if found\n        \"severity\": \"MEDIUM\",    // Replace with actual severity\n        \"description\": \"Example:  A potential memory leak.\",\n        \"cvss_score\": 5.0        // Replace with actual CVSS score\n      }\n    ],\n    \"confidence\": 0.9\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important Note:** The `confidence` score reflects my uncertainty about the completeness of the CVE list due to my limitations.
