# Docker Scanner Ideation Summary & Scope Definition

## Current State: Ideation Complete ✅

We've completed the ideation phase for AI-powered Docker vulnerability scanning with clear scope boundaries and technical approach defined.

## Technical Approach Agreed Upon

### Core Philosophy: AI-First + Image Layer Analysis

**Rejected Approach:** Static Dockerfile parsing with version guessing
- ❌ Inaccurate version resolution (`apt-get install nginx` → version unknown)
- ❌ AI "forecasting" package versions (unreliable)
- ❌ Repository queries (point-in-time, not what was actually installed)

**Agreed Approach:** Image layer extraction + AI CVE analysis
- ✅ Pull/build Docker images to analyze actual layers
- ✅ Extract exact package versions from filesystem databases
- ✅ Use AI for CVE analysis, not version guessing
- ✅ Map vulnerabilities back to Dockerfile source lines

### Technical Implementation Strategy

```python
# High-level workflow agreed upon:
def scan_docker_accurately(dockerfile_or_image):
    # 1. Ensure we have an image (build if needed)
    image = get_or_build_image(dockerfile_or_image)
    
    # 2. Extract layers without running container
    layers = extract_image_layers(image)
    
    # 3. Parse package databases from each layer
    packages = []
    for layer in layers:
        # Read /var/lib/dpkg/status, /lib/apk/db/installed, etc.
        layer_packages = parse_package_databases(layer)
        packages.extend(layer_packages)
    
    # 4. AI analysis with exact versions
    vulnerabilities = ai_model.analyze_vulnerabilities({
        "packages": packages,  # Exact versions!
        "context": "Docker layer analysis"
    })
    
    # 5. Map back to Dockerfile lines
    return map_to_source_locations(vulnerabilities, dockerfile)
```

## Scope Definition: What We Will & Won't Do

### ✅ IN SCOPE (Phase 1): Core Package Manager Coverage (~95%)

#### 1. **OS Base Packages**
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04  # ~200+ packages with exact versions
```
- All pre-installed OS packages from base images
- Exact versions from package databases
- **Why in scope:** Highest vulnerability density, exact version detection possible

#### 2. **Package Manager Installations** 
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx python3
```
- apt/apt-get (Debian/Ubuntu)
- apk (Alpine) 
- yum/dnf (RHEL/CentOS)
- All dependencies automatically detected
- **Why in scope:** Standard installation method, recorded in package databases

#### 3. **Package Updates/Upgrades**
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```
- Updated package versions after upgrades
- Security patches reflected in final layer
- **Why in scope:** Critical for accurate CVE detection, captured in package databases

#### 4. **Source Location Mapping**
- Map layer vulnerabilities back to Dockerfile lines
- Track which instruction introduced vulnerable packages
- **Why in scope:** Essential for remediation guidance

### ❌ OUT OF SCOPE (Phase 1): Edge Cases (~5%)

#### 4. **Manual Binary Installations**
```dockerfile
RUN wget https://download.oracle.com/java/17/jdk.tar.gz && tar -xzf jdk.tar.gz
```
- Manual downloads and extractions
- Binaries installed outside package managers
- Custom compilation and installation

**Why out of scope:**
- **Not in package databases** - our extraction method can't find them
- **Complex detection** - would require filesystem scanning, binary analysis
- **Low ROI** - represents ~5% of typical vulnerabilities
- **Phase 2 improvement** - can be addressed later with different techniques

**Future approaches for Phase 2:**
- Filesystem scanning for known binary patterns
- Version extraction from executable outputs
- Configuration file parsing
- Binary signature matching

### ✅ IN SCOPE (Other Scanners): Application Dependencies

#### 5. **Language Package Dependencies**
```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Python packages (requirements.txt, setup.py, etc.)
- JavaScript packages (package.json, yarn.lock, etc.)
- Other language ecosystems

**Why not Docker scanner scope:**
- **Better handled by language-specific scanners** - already implemented
- **Clean separation of concerns** - Docker handles infrastructure, language scanners handle applications
- **No duplication** - avoid parsing same files twice
- **Combined coverage** - when run together, provides complete analysis

**Division of responsibility:**
- **Docker Scanner:** Infrastructure vulnerabilities (OS, nginx binary, python3 binary)
- **Python Scanner:** Application vulnerabilities (Django, requests from requirements.txt)
- **Combined Analysis:** Complete security picture

## Expected Coverage & Accuracy

### Realistic Expectations by Image Type

| Image Type | Docker Scanner Coverage | Total Coverage (with language scanners) |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Official Base Images** | 95%+ | 98%+ |
| **Language Runtime Images** | 90%+ | 95%+ |
| **Application Images** | 85%+ | 93%+ |
| **Minimal/Distroless** | 70%+ | 85%+ |

### Coverage Breakdown for Typical Web App
```
Total Security Issues: 100%
├── OS & System Packages: 70% ✅ Docker Scanner (Phase 1)
├── Package Manager Apps: 15% ✅ Docker Scanner (Phase 1)  
├── Application Deps: 10% ✅ Language Scanners (existing)
├── Manual Installs: 4% ❌ Docker Scanner (Phase 2)
└── Container Runtime: 1% ❌ Out of scope
```

## Performance & Efficiency Requirements

### Laptop-Friendly Implementation
- **Target:** <30 seconds for typical image scan
- **Memory:** <200MB RAM usage during scan
- **Caching:** Aggressive layer caching for reuse
- **Streaming:** Process layers individually, not full image in memory

### Key Optimizations Planned
- Layer digest-based caching (most layers shared across images)
- Parallel processing with resource limits
- Stream extraction (don't load full filesystem)
- Smart batching for AI analysis

## AI Integration Strategy

### What AI Will Analyze
```python
# Input to AI model:
{
    "packages": [
        {"name": "nginx", "version": "1.18.0-0ubuntu1.2", "distro": "ubuntu"},
        {"name": "libssl1.1", "version": "1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.17", "distro": "ubuntu"}
    ],
    "context": "Ubuntu 20.04 Docker image analysis",
    "total_packages": 247
}

# AI provides:
# - CVE identification with exact version matching
# - Severity assessment with Ubuntu-specific context
# - Fix recommendations (upgrade paths)
# - Dependency chain analysis
```

### Why AI vs Traditional CVE Databases
- **Context awareness:** Understands distro-specific patches and mitigations
- **Current knowledge:** No database maintenance, stays up-to-date
- **Relationship analysis:** Can identify dependency vulnerabilities
- **Confidence scoring:** Provides nuanced risk assessment

## Next Steps (Implementation Phase)

### Phase 1a: Core Layer Extraction
- [ ] Implement Docker image layer extraction
- [ ] Parse dpkg/apk/rpm package databases
- [ ] Build package caching system

### Phase 1b: AI Integration

- [ ] Validate accuracy vs Trivy/Grype
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Success Criteria

### Accuracy Targets
- **Package Detection:** 95%+ accuracy for package-manager-installed software
- **Version Accuracy:** 100% accuracy for detected packages (exact versions from databases)
- **CVE Mapping:** Match or exceed traditional scanners for covered packages

### Performance Targets
- **Scan Time:** <30s for medium images (Ubuntu + apps)
- **Memory Usage:** <200MB peak memory usage
- **Cache Hit Rate:** >80% on second scan of same base layers

### User Experience

- **Actionable Results:** Source location mapping for remediation
- **Integration Ready:** Works seamlessly with existing language scanners

## Conclusion

We have a clear, technically sound approach for Docker vulnerability scanning that:

1. **Focuses on the 95%** - Package manager installed software where we can achieve high accuracy
2. **Uses AI appropriately** - For CVE analysis, not version guessing
3. **Complements existing scanners** - Clean division of responsibilities
4. **Sets realistic expectations** - Documents limitations transparently
5. **Provides upgrade path** - Clear roadmap for manual installation detection

Ready to move from ideation to implementation planning and detailed technical design.
