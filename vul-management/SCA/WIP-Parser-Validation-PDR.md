# Parser Validation via Open Source Test Suites - Product Design Requirements (PDR)

## Overview

This PDR defines a systematic approach to validate and improve our dependency parsers by leveraging test suites from established open source projects. By using battle-tested test cases from projects like pip-tools, poetry, and setuptools, we can ensure our parsers handle real-world edge cases correctly while enabling AI coding agents to apply test-driven development principles effectively.

## Background

### Current Challenge
Our dependency parsers need to handle complex real-world scenarios across multiple package ecosystems. While we have basic test coverage, we may be missing edge cases that established tools have already discovered and handle correctly.

### Conversation Summary
During development discussions, we identified that projects like pip-tools have extensive test suites covering numerous edge cases:
- Complex version specifiers (e.g., `package>=1.0,<2.0,!=1.5`)
- Environment markers (e.g., `package; python_version >= "3.8"`)
- URL-based dependencies
- Editable installs (`-e git+https://...`)
- Recursive requirements files
- Platform-specific dependencies

Using these test suites as benchmarks would provide a systematic way to validate our parser quality while aligning with our "only make new mistakes" tenet.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Comprehensive Parser Validation** - Ensure our parsers handle all real-world edge cases correctly
2. **Test-Driven Improvement** - Enable AI coding agents to systematically improve parsers using TDD
3. **Quality Assurance** - Achieve parser quality on par with industry-standard tools
4. **Knowledge Transfer** - Learn from the collective experience of the open source community

### Success Metrics
- 95%+ compatibility with pip-tools test cases for Python parsing
- 95%+ compatibility with relevant test suites for each supported ecosystem
- Zero regressions when updating parsers
- Documented rationale for any intentional parsing differences

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Test Suite Integration
1. **Test Extraction**
   - Extract test fixtures from target OSS projects
   - Convert test cases to our testing framework format
   - Maintain attribution and licensing compliance

2. **Parser Validation**
   - Run our parsers against extracted test fixtures
   - Compare outputs with expected results
   - Generate compatibility reports

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - Identify parsing differences
   - Categorize as bugs vs intentional design decisions
   - Create issues for each identified gap

4. **Continuous Validation**
   - Automate test suite synchronization
   - Run validation in CI/CD pipeline
   - Alert on new test failures

### Target Projects for Validation

#### Python Ecosystem
- **pip-tools** - Requirements.txt parsing edge cases
- **poetry** - pyproject.toml parsing validation
- **setuptools** - setup.py and setup.cfg parsing
- **pip** - Core requirements parsing logic
- **pipenv** - Pipfile parsing validation

#### JavaScript Ecosystem
- **npm** - package.json parsing
- **yarn** - yarn.lock parsing
- **pnpm** - pnpm-workspace.yaml parsing

#### Other Ecosystems
- **cargo** - Rust Cargo.toml parsing
- **bundler** - Ruby Gemfile parsing
- **composer** - PHP composer.json parsing

### Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Framework Setup
1. Create test harness for running external test suites
2. Implement test case conversion utilities
3. Set up compatibility reporting

#### Phase 2: Python Ecosystem
1. Start with pip-tools as proof of concept
2. Extract and convert test cases
3. Run validation and fix identified issues
4. Expand to other Python tools

#### Phase 3: Other Ecosystems
1. Apply learnings from Python to other languages
2. Prioritize based on usage statistics
3. Maintain ecosystem-specific test suites

### AI Agent Considerations

#### Test-Driven Development Enablement
- Each external test case becomes a TDD opportunity
- AI agents can systematically work through failures
- Clear success criteria (matching expected output)
- Traceable decision history for parsing differences

#### Learning Integration
- Failed tests generate new test cases in our suite
- Document why certain behaviors differ
- Build comprehensive "lessons learned" test file
- Share discoveries across parser implementations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Test validation should complete within CI/CD time limits
- Incremental validation for changed parsers only
- Cached test fixtures to reduce external dependencies

### Maintainability
- Clear mapping between external tests and our test suite
- Version tracking for external test suites
- Automated update notifications

### Documentation
- Compatibility matrix for each parser
- Rationale for intentional differences
- Edge case catalog with examples

## Out of Scope

1. **Modifying External Projects** - We only consume their tests, not contribute back
2. **100% Compatibility** - Some parsing differences may be intentional
3. **Private/Proprietary Test Suites** - Only use publicly available tests

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: License Compatibility
**Mitigation**: Carefully review licenses, only use test data (not code), maintain proper attribution

### Risk: Test Suite Changes
**Mitigation**: Version-lock test suites, review changes before updating

### Risk: False Positives
**Mitigation**: Allow for documented intentional differences, focus on functional compatibility

## Implementation Status

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Requirements Gathering

**Next Steps**:
1. Deep dive into pip-tools test suite structure
2. Prototype test extraction and conversion process
3. Define compatibility reporting format
4. Create detailed implementation plan
