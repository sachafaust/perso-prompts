Based on our experience, here's the refined prompt that captures the successful approach:

```
# Enhanced SCA Scanner Implementation Specification

## Overview
Create a production-ready Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scanner that identifies vulnerable dependencies across multiple programming languages, with emphasis on Python ecosystems. The scanner must use live vulnerability databases and provide comprehensive security analysis.

## Core Requirements
